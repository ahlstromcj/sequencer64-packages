README for Sequencer64-packages (and now Seq66)

2017-04-19 to 2020-08-14

Latest version is "0.96.5" in the "latest" subdirectory.

----------------------------------
HOWEVER, for Windows we are standardizing on our related "Seq66" project,
which has more features now, and is better debugged.  It is stored here, in
the Seq66/0.90 directory.  The latest version of qpseq66 is 0.90.5. Get that
one instead!!!
----------------------------------

Sequencer64 is a reboot of seq24.  It extends seq24 in features and bug fixes;
the heart of seq24 remains intact.  See the sequencer64 project on GitHub:

    http://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64.git

This project provides 32-bit and 64-bit Debian packages of older builds of
Sequencer64, and we will be trying self-extracting archives for static builds
of the "rtmidi" version of Sequencer64, seq64.  Also, the usual source-code
tarballs (that support the "./configure" command) are now provided, though
usually out-of-date.

And, at last, we provide "Sequencer64 For Windows".  The current version,
0.96.0, is nearly full-featured, and uses a Qt 5 user-interface.  It is
distributed as a portable Zip file that you can extract to a directory, and
then create a short-cut to the qpseq64.exe executable file.  An NSIS installer
executable is also available.

For Windows, you also need to navigate to Control Panel / Sound / Playback /
Speakers / Advanced, and then check-mark this item:

    "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device"

Once done, qpseq64 should be able to play to the "Microsoft GS Wavetable
Synthesizer".  See the README.windows file for more information.

Some users are finding issues installing the deb on KX Studio and other
music-specific distros.  The latest deb in the 0.93.3 directory is:

    sequencer64-kxstudio-ubuntu-14.04.5-LTS_0.93.3-0_amd64.deb

is meant to fix these issues, but please test it and let us know what happens.
It was build in a KX Studio VM and works in that VM when installed.

Please let us know if you find issues with these packages.  If you have
a build for another version of Linux that you want to publish here, we will
can host it.
