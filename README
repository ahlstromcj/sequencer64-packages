README for Sequencer64 (and Seq66) Packages

Latest version of Sequencer64 is "0.96.5" in the "latest" subdirectory.  We
will be removing earlier versions soon.  This is the last version of
Sequencer64 for Windows, because we are standardizing on our related "Seq66"
project, which has more features, is leaner, and is better debugged.  It is
stored here, in the Seq66/0.93 directory.  The latest version of the installer
and 7-zip portable package is 0.93.0.  The most-up-to-date documentation can
be found in the "Seq66" GitHub project.

Sequencer64 and Seq66 are major reboots of seq24.  They extend seq24 in
features and bug fixes; the heart of seq24 remains intact.  See the
sequencer64 and seq66 projects on GitHub:

The current version of "Sequencer64 For Windows" is full-featured, and uses a
Qt 5 user-interface.  It is distributed as a portable Zip file that you can
extract to a directory, and then create a short-cut to the qpseq64.exe
executable file.  An NSIS installer executable is also available.

For Windows, you also need to navigate to Control Panel / Sound / Playback /
Speakers / Advanced, and then check-mark this item:

    "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device"

Once done, qpseq64 should be able to play to the "Microsoft GS Wavetable
Synthesizer".  See the README.windows file for more information.

Some users are finding issues installing the deb on KX Studio and other
music-specific distros.  The latest deb in the 0.93.3 directory is:

    sequencer64-kxstudio-ubuntu-14.04.5-LTS_0.93.3-0_amd64.deb

is meant to fix these issues, but please test it and let us know what happens.
It was build in a KX Studio VM and works in that VM when installed.

Please let us know if you find issues with these packages.  If you have
a build for another version of Linux that you want to publish here, we will
can host it.
